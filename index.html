                    This is a picture of me when i was 4 years old and my grandmother was the one who take a good care 
                    of me and my other brothers because my mom used to work at a company for 10 years, but now shes 
                    already retired. Furthermore, as what u can see on the picture beside, I was celebrating me and my
                    younger brothers birthday and we are enjoying the cake after the picture was taken. We had a lot 
                    of fun as we can gather and spent time more than we usually did. In addition, my younger brother`s 
                    birthday is 20th of August 2005.
                    <br>
                    My eldest brother named Muhammad Aiman, meanwhile my other younger brothers named Muhammad Ammar, 
                    Muhammad Amri, Muhammad Azri, Muhammad Ashraff, Muhammad Fitri. All of them mostly have my fathers 
                    face, however, im the only one who looks like my mother as we resembles each other very much that 
                    people tend to think we are siblings, haha funny right?! However, i have my father`s attitude.

                    My hobby is to play with my cats as i found it entertaining to have fun with them. They are so cute, 
                    sweet, and just by looking at their faces would make anyone melt. However, most of my cats are dead 
                    because of the disease that spreading because of flu.
